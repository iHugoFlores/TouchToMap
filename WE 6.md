# Weekend 6 Assignment: TouchToMap
##Due: April 30, 2020

## Part 1: The Map


We want to discover interesting places. For this, you must show a map with several interesting sites (of your choice).

As a user I want to be able to choose a site and see a mark on the map (one pin). You can interact with the pin and see a brief description of the site such as: name (or title), description, an image or even a video if the site contains such information.

## Part 2: Security

Surely they are sites that only the user wants to know that he/she has visited and the user does not want anyone else to see those sites.

Add a view with an authentication method at the very begining. The map can only be displayed if the user passes the biometric test.

##### Please perform the requirements described inside, as well as the additional following:

* Use TouchID and FaceID.
* Swift as main language.
* Use MVC architecture design.
* Provide a way to terminate the app. 
* You need to locate the information presented by the pin.
* One of the following:
	* Create a screen within the interesting places and the user can easily back and forward to review each place.
	* Ensure the accessibility feature is enabled for all the elements in the app. You need to locale those elements.
	* No pods are required but is fine if you want to add one (justify the usage).
